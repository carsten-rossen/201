This repo is all about getting familiar with using basic bash and PowerShell commands to perform and automate tasks. There may come a time when I have to perform simple tasks on every office computer in a whole company, so learning how to automate them has the potential to save time and energy.

In Ops 201, I learned how to:
- backup my computer system using tactics such as System Restore

- solve problems using the CompTIA 6-step troubleshooting process

- navigate and analyze the Windows Registry
- understand and troubleshoot BSODs
- backup virtual machines using Veeam
- restore data
- properly and securely dispose of data
- virtualize a router using pfSense
