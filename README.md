This repo is all about getting familiar with using basic bash and PowerShell commands to perform and automate tasks. There may come a time when I have to perform simple tasks on every office computer in a whole company, so learning how to automate them has the potential to save time and energy.

In Ops 201, I learned how to:
- backup my computer system using tactics such as System Restore
- use developer tools such as Visual Studio Code
- utilize soft skills in tandem with remote services in order to help clients solve common technical problems
- solve problems using the CompTIA 6-step troubleshooting process
- navigate and use the Windows Defender Security Center
- upgrade an OS without losing personal data
- navigate and analyze the Windows Registry
- understand and troubleshoot BSODs
- backup virtual machines using Veeam
- restore data
- properly and securely dispose of data
- virtualize a router using pfSense
- use malware remediation software and tools to prevent, signal, and eradicate malware
- create virtual machines in the cloud using AWS

My favorite ops challenge was seattle-ops201d2-challenge06.sh. This script allows the user to search for ports on a specified computer. I feel that the script is very useful, and also that I did a good job creating a script that optimizes user experience by communicating back and forth with the user.
